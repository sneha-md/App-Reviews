In order to play ""local"" files, you have to transfer them from phone to computer, then upload them to Google Play Music. You can't simply upload music from mobile. EDIT: There is the Bluetooth workaround for local files, but you can only connect to 1-2 speakers at a time and must control them independently."

For example, Google still offers some free storage where Amazon bugged out completely.  Unfortunately, the Google Home app does not allow users to delete ghost audio groups.  A host of similar inadequacies make me concerned that Google is not committed to this activity.  After so many people have purchase literally billions of dollars, is Google going to abandoned it in a few years because they just lose interest?  Is this just another corporate tinkering dressing up the old bait and switch?  I sure hope not."

I try to delete and unlink speaker groups in the app, when i restart the app the speaker groups are once again linked in there. something is wrong with the service that will not allow you to unlink a speaker group.

The Hub implies it does the same because it has the Google Assist built in, but that's not true. You can verbally ask Hub for your specific news/music, but the display does not show your preferred by default. So display is almost useless and that's why you're buying it. Still Google outshines Echo as far as AI. So much potential being missed."

In addition to above now if you are getting matches, you will find no one once you open the chat window. Past week I got a couple of matches, on opening the window there was no one to be seen.

,"Brent M","March 5, 2019",3,"Google Home Mini was working great when I first set it up. However, we just changed internet carriers and I can't get it reconnected. It tells me to go to Google Home, select Devices and Setup. Well, here I am on the computer and the only device that shows up is an old LG phone that I no longer use, with no option to select other devices. I've tried going online to find solutions but don't have the time at the moment to listen to some guy blabber on for 10 min on YouTube about how to do it. Was hoping there'd be a simpler way. Tried adding the Google Home app to my phone and stand beside the unit in the kitchen. Still nothing. The sparse start-up guide provided with the unit is useless. Wondering how I set it up in the first place. Definitely not user-friendly and certainly not time efficient!"

Most hotels require a splash screen acceptance, which the Chromecast can't do.  Therefore, I normally have to use my mobile phone as a hotspot.  I can't do that, and have it on WiFi at the same time.  I don't carry an additional mobile device with me, so it's now impossible to make changes to my Chromecast on arrival at a new hotel.  I've struggled with this for awhile now, and I've finally decided that unless there's some secret way to make this work, I'm going to buy a competitor's streaming device soon."

I had paid for subscription and got to use it for 3 days. Not acceptable at all. Do not bother with this app. Waste of time."

I cannot see who swiped right on me or rather who likes me without tinder gold which is so expensive even for a one month subscription. I wiped close to a week to see if anything would change to see if I could see who liked me and possibly get a match to start a conversation but nothing has changed this app is a ripe off I DO NOT RECOMMEND!"

It also cycles the same few people that I've already swiped left on. A pointless feature."

,"Wesley Atkinson","April 23, 2019",3,"Pros: Can use vine-like videos as profile pics, can tap (much quicker and easier on the wrists) or swipe, more users than most, if not all, other dating apps Cons: Limited likes, and constant ads and asks to join premium, too easy to swipe up (super like) on accident, have to pay for undos, no relationship filter Annoyances: ""Show Me"" really needs more options, because there's an awful lot of couples showing up in my Women only searches.

I immediately had my ""likes me"" que, and it had several people in it. Unfortunately, after I cleared it the first time no one else has showed up. It's been a week since a single person has appeared. I know it's not because no one has liked my profile in that time because I've swiped and got matches since then. (Not the matches that show up an hour later because someone else swiped seconds, but the matches you get instantly because you were the second person to swipe right) I have a big problem with paying for something that doesn't work as advertised. Fix it and my review will be 5 stars again."

It still will be way off at times, but not as much as it did a year ago.👍🏻 Very thankful for this app and that it's SUPER affordable!! 🙌 Keep up the great work guys!! ❤️"

I've been sold a prototype as a finished product and that's simply not okay."
,"A Google User","February 21, 2019",2,"There are two major issues in my view. Firstly, the app feels too complex and unintuitive, a month later I'm still struggling with the navigation sometimes. Secondly, needs to support more music apps, Amazon music for example! The googlecast function doesn't work well at all with Amazon music, the playback is patchy and intermittent. Similarly, the quality of music is bad over Bluetooth with Apple music. This is a speaker, so the priority should be playing music properly!!"

Trying to use the 3 day trial is risky as you need to provide payment details even though your trying to get something for free.

They literally restrict the profile once you upgrade to gold. This was the last time i paid for it. Edit: Paying for the app is the worst thing you will do. Gold is screwed. In addition to above now if you are getting matches, you will find no one once you open the chat window. Past week I got a couple of matches, on opening the window there was no one to be seen.

,"Dee Ann","April 29, 2019",2,"Recently there was a bug that made users unable to see new messages or matches. This forced users to re-install, to reinstate functioning. However, on the new version now you'll find permissions are pulled in a different way. Location permission is pulled permanently, even if you did not tick the box to allow this, and asked for permission to be requested each time. I think Google needs to police this aspect. Also heaps more ads. Try Coffee Meets Bagel as a good alternative!"

I don't think that I have ever seen even 1 single ad, I mention this because typically if an app is free and it works good too then they usually will also have some annoying ads, it's rare when they have no ads at all.

Ambient Mode must be running on an 8bit processor someone kept from 30 years ago as it would forget all albums bit a random 250-ish of them. It worked fine for years before Home came and broke it.

PCH is a great place to play fun games with the chance of incentives. I know that if I won the 7k a week I'd try to do so much good in the world.

UPDATE: latest version has improved scheduled routines, and allows colour selection for smart bulbs, but has introduced a set of new problems. The app is full of graphical glitches now and regularly crashes! Oh, and it still cant remember which device to play routines on for very long. The UI still has way too much blank space too."

,"Ryker","February 28, 2019",4,"Dear Google, *PLEASE* add the ability to text and open apps on your Android device with Google Home! Otherwise, you need to make a work around for when people want to send a text. I always have an Android phone near by. But I can't ask Google Assistant to send a text. Why? Because Google Home keeps intercepting my requests. I understand the principle, of not having two devices answer a request simultaneously. However when it comes to texts, it's Google Home who ought to stop listening temporary."

,"Mike S","April 29, 2019",1,"Useless app.  It has less control options for Chromecast than the previous Chromecast interface app and it's a horrible interface for the Philips Hue home lighting system, a VERY popular and widely used home lighting package.  Once connected to the Hue Hub this app uploads the light bulbs along with EVERYTHING else, like lighting themes, remote control settings, etc. from the hub and lists it all as light bulbs. I ended up with 37 ""bulbs"" listed, even though I only have 11 actual Hue light bulbs.  I tried to delete the incorrect bulbs but the app wouldn't let me.  So to get rid of the ""Summer Sunset"" light bulb (even though it's a lighting scene, NOT a bulb), I had to create a new pseudo-room called ""Shed"" and assign the unwanted items to the ""Shed"" room to get them out of the list of real, actual, working Hue bulbs throughout my house.  In general this is a horrible app!!!!!"

Also, the GUI is clunky, counterintuitive and difficult to use. If Google made it function more like Netflix's or Hulu's apps, with a simple menu system and the necessary playback controls, it'd be a hit. The Chromecast device itself works great when playing videos but the app needs serious bug fixes and a total overhaul of the GUI. Keep the menu short and sweet with easy access."

I'm generally a fan of how tinder has decided to monetize itself with gold and boosts. However, the app has gotten increasingly buggy. Often times I get a notification about a new match or message, but can't see it unless i completely log out or reinstall. Unfortunately I doubt the girls I'm talking with are willing to go through the same hassle."

It's pretty obvious that the creators only wants people who pay to be successful on the app."

If you check my status you will see why I have VIP Elite status...im a everyday player but what really is the point in playing if your ad repetitveness continues."

The character limit for profiles is strict, but I also wish people were required to put SOMETHING in there.

Tinder basically tries to grab your money in every way possible, making the user experience terrible. All the more reason to use Bumble instead. At least they respect their users"

,"Andy Squibbs","April 19, 2019",1,"I got banned for absolutely nothing as well. No nudes, no offensive language, and no inappropriate behaviour. It's really strange how there is no appeal system on this, considering its fast becoming one of the main prospective partners, or even just hookups, to meet. At least give an explanation to people as to why. Don't just hail the algorithm as God, as I assume it wasn't a user complaint, rather a missinterpreted photo by a program.

They have always been a little buggy but this is another level. Speaker groups are either not seen, or only partially seen. When I am able to connect to them, I can't adjust volume (group or or individually) through the Home app as I used to be able to. Things seem to work slightly better if I only use voice commands. It is incredibly frustrating as I prefer to use the app to control my setup. I have reset both my router and all my Homes / Chromecasts etc daily during this stretch and nothing has improved. It seems there are other reviewers here seeing similar results over this same time frame. Please help."

I have done everything from reinstall's, memory resets and factory resets. Still the app just quits. If you are developing an app, maybe make sure it works with older devices as it did when it first came out. Maybe even test a bit before releasing it. Not everyone purchases new devices just because they are new."

Tinder ignored all my requests for help. - Since then, the very few matches I get have all turned out to be spam or even scams. Apparently, Tinder now only lets me match with profiles which other users have reported. Tinder is a SCAM too"

I have tried to manually crash the app, uninstall/reinstall it and nothing works! This is a huge functionality loss as I can't set smart plugs or lights to turn on or off at certain times.

Setting up custom routines is really useful, but the most frustrating thing about the app is that routines can't be toggled on or off. I have some complex alarms and broadcasts on various days (too complex for voice commands) and the only way I can stop these at the moment (eg on school holidays) is to delete the whole routine. Google Home could be a fantastic app."

,"Nikos Gkolfinos","April 21, 2019",1,"Saw the app in an ad and downloaded for fun without knowing what is is about. But in a world of million apps, it's not good to start the app by requesting to choose 3-day trial or yearly £70+ because people like FREE STUFF. People are going to pay for something that they know what is going to give back otherwise they dont want to be tied up with any kind if subscription, even if you can cancel it. Maybe this app is the best in the world but the way it starts it is not appealing."

I don't know what is the internal ELO score algorithm that you guys have implemented but since when you introduced the boosts I passed from 3/4 matches a day to 3/4 matches a week with the same pictures. I believe it's because my profile is just shown to many less people unless I pay for the boosts or just because you give me a penalty based on this ELO score. Honestly a lot of time swiping for very few results. Waste of time. App deleted until further developments."

I wouldn't ever do anything to violate their terms of service and come to find out there is no way to find out if somebody hacked my account. I Emailed them to no avail. Now I get notices all the time that women are interested n me and I log in and am still banned. I don't know if someone is impersonating me online or what.,  Tinder needs to be more forthcoming in responding to customer service as far as security. It's very scary to think that I gave Tinder my personal information, Phone Number, Facebook info & Photos and now it's being used for god knows what and they could care less about your personal security.."

Apparently, Tinder wants to keep those fake users active so people will continue to pay for this bogus app. If Tinder forced users to verify their account with their cell phone cams and post at least four clear face pictures, the number of spam bots and cam girls wouls drop. Instead, Tinder continues to enable fraudulent users to abuse its platform."

I get notifications from the app saying that I have a new match, I check to see who it is but nothing is displayed. The same goes for chats. I get a notification that I have a new message but I can't see any from the person I'm supposed to have received a message from. Worse is: it doesn't dissappear."

,"Hadiqah Anwar","April 24, 2019",1,"This app is awful! I tried the aging one and took a pic and when I wanted to see what the results r it said that I need premium to check it. I also tried a few other and the same happened. Personally, I definitely would NOT recommend this. I judt downloaded it and now I'm already deleting it. It also wouldn't let me press the 'X' button at the top for the trial thing. 😞"

,"James Rich","April 24, 2019",1,"Listen I am only 10 years old and my name is not James. I did not like how I was so excited to see my future me, because everyone is always telling me that I am ugly and I wanted to see if I was pretty in the future and the second I opened the app I was greeted by something saying that I have to pay or I can't do anything on the app. I am not the type of person who cares about looks or about what I wear but when people tell me I am ugly I do care. All I wanted was to see my future self but I can't pay like that. Try to make the app free and more accurate. I know it will be hard to make it more accurate but you can at least try. This app is not for people who don't want to pay. If you want more people to have your app then you need to make it free or at least much cheaper. I am sorry but I have to uninstall the app. Please listen to what I have said. I am not trying to be rude or offensive. Have a wonderful day all of you who are reading this.😉"

Still aggravating, can't recommend this app. Old review: Buggy, very touchy about internet connection. Crashes too frequently. Cash Frenzy Live is especially unpleasant and borderline pointless, since that three minute window to get in the game is spent fighting error messages instead of checking in."
