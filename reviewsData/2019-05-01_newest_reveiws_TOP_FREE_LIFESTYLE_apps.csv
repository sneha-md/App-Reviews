I've tried naming the Chromecast Television and the result is the same. And yes, my shield is called Shield. I've tried naming the Chromecast Telly. When I say, Hey Google, turn on Telly. It transcribes ""Turn on Telly"" and turns on the TV but when I say, Hey Google, turn off Telly, it transcribes, ""Turn off Telle"", (WITH AN 'E') and says, I'm sorry, something went wrong. Ugh!!!! I've tried naming the Chromecast Tube. This turns on the TV just fine but when I say turn off Tube it returns me YouTube results. Double UGH!!!!!  I've finally named it BOX. This seems to work. For now. :(  You definitely need to look into this issue."

In order to play ""local"" files, you have to transfer them from phone to computer, then upload them to Google Play Music. You can't simply upload music from mobile. EDIT: There is the Bluetooth workaround for local files, but you can only connect to 1-2 speakers at a time and must control them independently."

For example, Google still offers some free storage where Amazon bugged out completely.  Unfortunately, the Google Home app does not allow users to delete ghost audio groups.  A host of similar inadequacies make me concerned that Google is not committed to this activity.  After so many people have purchase literally billions of dollars, is Google going to abandoned it in a few years because they just lose interest?  Is this just another corporate tinkering dressing up the old bait and switch?  I sure hope not."

Mostly kids would want this app, and kids do not have credit cards; that forces the parent to put all info in, which is frustrating for the parent, as they know marketing techniques."

The only service I wish it had is Amazon Prime. I suspect Amazon is holding out so it can sell more Fire TV devices, which, like Roku, costs 3 times as much as a Chromecast, but does the same thing. Chromecast would get five stars if it worked on 5 Ghz ac WiFi networks, but it's limited to working on only the older, 2.4 Ghz,"

You can verbally ask Hub for your specific news/music, but the display does not show your preferred by default. So display is almost useless and that's why you're buying it. Still Google outshines Echo as far as AI. So much potential being missed."

I would not recommend this app to anyone that's looking to down tinder. also, customer service was not helpful at all for they have yet to respond to my questions in my emails to them. sad excuse for an app if I do say so myself"
,"Sa'ad Suleman","April 22, 2019",4,"Great app, easy touse, brilliant UI that works. I took one star off due to the user experience which is, you guessed it, high demand for professional white men. I got no matches for weeks, swapped my picture for an average looking white guy, kept the profile details the same and my phone couldn't handle the amount of likes. Sad and heart breaking racist attitudes in UK, and its not white women who are doing it, its every race chasing white men with average jobs."

In addition to above now if you are getting matches, you will find no one once you open the chat window. Past week I got a couple of matches, on opening the window there was no one to be seen.

It tells me to go to Google Home, select Devices and Setup. Well, here I am on the computer and the only device that shows up is an old LG phone that I no longer use, with no option to select other devices. I've tried going online to find solutions but don't have the time at the moment to listen to some guy blabber on for 10 min on YouTube about how to do it. Was hoping there'd be a simpler way. Tried adding the Google Home app to my phone and stand beside the unit in the kitchen. Still nothing. The sparse start-up guide provided with the unit is useless. Wondering how I set it up in the first place. Definitely not user-friendly and certainly not time efficient!"

Most hotels require a splash screen acceptance, which the Chromecast can't do.  Therefore, I normally have to use my mobile phone as a hotspot.  I can't do that, and have it on WiFi at the same time.  I don't carry an additional mobile device with me, so it's now impossible to make changes to my Chromecast on arrival at a new hotel.  I've struggled with this for awhile now, and I've finally decided that unless there's some secret way to make this work, I'm going to buy a competitor's streaming device soon."

I had paid for subscription and got to use it for 3 days. Not acceptable at all. Do not bother with this app. Waste of time."

I cannot see who swiped right on me or rather who likes me without tinder gold which is so expensive even for a one month subscription. I wiped close to a week to see if anything would change to see if I could see who liked me and possibly get a match to start a conversation but nothing has changed this app is a ripe off I DO NOT RECOMMEND!"

It also cycles the same few people that I've already swiped left on. A pointless feature."

,"Wesley Atkinson","April 23, 2019",3,"Pros: Can use vine-like videos as profile pics, can tap (much quicker and easier on the wrists) or swipe, more users than most, if not all, other dating apps Cons: Limited likes, and constant ads and asks to join premium, too easy to swipe up (super like) on accident, have to pay for undos, no relationship filter Annoyances: ""Show Me"" really needs more options, because there's an awful lot of couples showing up in my Women only searches.

I immediately had my ""likes me"" que, and it had several people in it. Unfortunately, after I cleared it the first time no one else has showed up. It's been a week since a single person has appeared. I know it's not because no one has liked my profile in that time because I've swiped and got matches since then. (Not the matches that show up an hour later because someone else swiped seconds, but the matches you get instantly because you were the second person to swipe right) I have a big problem with paying for something that doesn't work as advertised. Fix it and my review will be 5 stars again."

Also, 3 weeks ago, tinder started matching me up with women over 1000 miles away. All of them would show 83 miles away, and yet they were all actually 4 states away. It started happening after my upgrade to a paying account 03/29/19. Obviously a poorly designed App, if u have to Google how to get their reoccurring billing to stop!"

Forcing people to use this app is how you lose customers. Chromecast above all other streaming devices was simple and easy now its trash.

Similarly, the quality of music is bad over Bluetooth with Apple music. This is a speaker, so the priority should be playing music properly!!"

In addition to above now if you are getting matches, you will find no one once you open the chat window. Past week I got a couple of matches, on opening the window there was no one to be seen.

,"Navn","April 20, 2019",1,"I changed my settings to view male profiles to check out my competition. Didn't know my face would be visible to all the gay tinder users of Oslo. After what I can only describe as a tsunami of likes, I understood this app is not well suited for straight males. It just crushes your confidence and wasts your time. Hope the playing field will be leveled out some day."
,"Anubhav Gaur","April 20, 2019",1,"As expected, I bought Tinder gold for a month. During this whole month's subscription somehow I got 2 matches using the boost but those also didn't respond well.

Otherwise, this is a useful product. 4/26/19- Difficulty with the product. Frequently, when I know someone is driving on a street they remain in one position for 20 to 30 seconds, then their icon will jump a quarter of a mile to a new location. something's up with the location resolution. Both phones set to highest location accuracy."

,"SILENT_484","April 22, 2019",1,"I swear this app is nothing but fake accounts, models who want cashapps or want to be followed on social media and lack of communication. Gold tinder doesnt help anything because like's get glitched(not shown), matches don't ever respond or just immediately unmatch and the boost is flawed. Honestly the time i've been on this app it just feels like a whole scam. The services need to be fixed or at least live up to their promises."

,"Craig Christman","April 22, 2019",1,"Tinder is terrible. My account had some words in it that were ""off color"", then Tinder banned me from their site. Funny thing is, I've seen women with those ""off color"" words in their profiles and nothing is done about it. Seems fishy. ""Women, do and say what you want, men, you're restricted from certain words. Thanks, Tinder"". No big loss being banned I suppose ."

Because Google Home keeps intercepting my requests. I understand the principle, of not having two devices answer a request simultaneously.

,"Mike S","April 29, 2019",1,"Useless app.  It has less control options for Chromecast than the previous Chromecast interface app and it's a horrible interface for the Philips Hue home lighting system, a VERY popular and widely used home lighting package.  Once connected to the Hue Hub this app uploads the light bulbs along with EVERYTHING else, like lighting themes, remote control settings, etc. from the hub and lists it all as light bulbs. I ended up with 37 ""bulbs"" listed, even though I only have 11 actual Hue light bulbs.  I tried to delete the incorrect bulbs but the app wouldn't let me.  So to get rid of the ""Summer Sunset"" light bulb (even though it's a lighting scene, NOT a bulb), I had to create a new pseudo-room called ""Shed"" and assign the unwanted items to the ""Shed"" room to get them out of the list of real, actual, working Hue bulbs throughout my house.  In general this is a horrible app!!!!!"

Also, the GUI is clunky, counterintuitive and difficult to use. If Google made it function more like Netflix's or Hulu's apps, with a simple menu system and the necessary playback controls, it'd be a hit. The Chromecast device itself works great when playing videos but the app needs serious bug fixes and a total overhaul of the GUI. Keep the menu short and sweet with easy access."

,"Mercedes Gosnell","April 20, 2019",2,"It's just barely okay. Very limited features. No search or filters, really. I even paid for Gold, and honestly, the only useful thing has been the Oops/Go back function. One boost a month is cheap and useless, and the Top Picks don't seem to adjust based on my actions or preferences. The character limit for profiles is strict, but I also wish people were required to put SOMETHING in there. I've also run out of people like 8 times now, and I've had to repeatedly reject the same profiles."

It was a copy-paste of the response taken from FAQs. They didn't even analyze and find the actual problem. when I replied expressing the dissatisfaction, I got ZERO response yet"

Sent them a feedback email instructing them to remove my premium account with the associated email. These app developers better do their part and cancel my premium or these guys might have a fraud case on their hands. ADD A CHOICE TO THE SETTINGS TO DISABLE THE PREMIUM!

It's really strange how there is no appeal system on this, considering its fast becoming one of the main prospective partners, or even just hookups, to meet. At least give an explanation to people as to why. Don't just hail the algorithm as God, as I assume it wasn't a user complaint, rather a missinterpreted photo by a program.

Please reply to my comment so I can get rid of the boring, old and tired voice I have been using for the last year and a half. I would really quite like to change to a male voice to change some things along because I personally think (not being sexist) that it sounds a lot more soothing. thanks, HyDrO_PLP"

Whenever I try to manage one of my devices through Google Home, it just crashes. I guess I will just junk everything google as it is dependent in most cases on new devices. I have done everything from reinstall's, memory resets and factory resets. Still the app just quits. If you are developing an app, maybe make sure it works with older devices as it did when it first came out. Maybe even test a bit before releasing it. Not everyone purchases new devices just because they are new."
,"A Google User","March 22, 2019",1,"Not sure what changed, but at the moment I can't cast neither video nor audio to my Nvidia Shield, either from my Pixel 3XL or Google Mini. Up until I added the Mini, casting from the Pixel to the Shield wasn't great, but it worked, sometimes (Netflix never worked). Now it's completely useless and does not do what it's meant to. I've cleared cache and data, uninstalled Google app, Google Home, removed my devices, re-added them and still doesn't work. All in the same WiFi ntwrk too. Frustrating.."

Now I get notices all the time that women are interested n me and I log in and am still banned. I don't know if someone is impersonating me online or what.,  Tinder needs to be more forthcoming in responding to customer service as far as security. It's very scary to think that I gave Tinder my personal information, Phone Number, Facebook info & Photos and now it's being used for god knows what and they could care less about your personal security.."

I feel that Google need better support, it is frustrating that the person helping you, cannot access your account or History to check what went wrong. I have done all troubleshooting i could find..

I get notifications from the app saying that I have a new match, I check to see who it is but nothing is displayed. The same goes for chats. I get a notification that I have a new message but I can't see any from the person I'm supposed to have received a message from. Worse is: it doesn't dissappear."

All I wanted was to see my future self but I can't pay like that. Try to make the app free and more accurate. I know it will be hard to make it more accurate but you can at least try. This app is not for people who don't want to pay. If you want more people to have your app then you need to make it free or at least much cheaper.

Still aggravating, can't recommend this app. Old review: Buggy, very touchy about internet connection. Crashes too frequently. Cash Frenzy Live is especially unpleasant and borderline pointless, since that three minute window to get in the game is spent fighting error messages instead of checking in."
