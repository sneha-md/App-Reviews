(best series since Sopranos) Now when it comes to cannabis docs, Netflix is fair.

Most other movie apps would be forgotten because of how much that one was downloaded. I understand the concept of making money, but if you wanted to get an HD version of the movie you should have to pay for that, but not watching movies when you could just buy them at a store."

Despite this, it is redeemed slightly by high quality streaming, the in-stream IMBD info is a cool feature, automatical PI, and notifications when you switch to mobile data are all handy too."

,"Espi Schaefer","April 28, 2019",1,"The remote takes forever to get to and get working. There is no longer the pure remote in the center. It is now four white thin arrows that you have to slide your finger on to get working, which means most of the time you swipe past what you want. The center ""OK"" button is no longer there. It has been replaced with a sentence that says something like ""Tap here"" but longer. You have to tap around that general area a few times+ before the remote will click on what you want. This is ridiculous."

Hulu is something I am paying for and it acts fine sometimes but most of the time, I am waiting for a show to load after a long day of work and I have to sit there and listen to the show play for two seconds then load again and then repeat. Instead of being entertained Hulu is making me angry, which is a shame cause I am paying for it and it has a great selection."

You get a trailer/ad for another one of their shows or movies which you don't have to wait to skip which makes it pointless. There isn't an option to disable it either. The only way to bypass it is to download the things you want to watch. Also when you open the app sometimes you get a trailer as well. The app has a good variety of stuff and it's probably worth the money"

Had lots of adds(commercials), but i guess that's what you get when you get free TV. What made me uninstall the app was it buffered A LOT. if the makers of this app could/would fix that, id be willing to reinstall the app. It's SOOO annoying to be watching a show & it starts to buffer while you're trying to watch a show! Even more so when it happens like every few minutes or so!"

But this app seems to crash out and need restarting every time you open it, and then when you leave it alone long enough to watch something, it will probably crash or disconnect when you wake up your phone. So i suppose it's better than nothing, but you'd have to admit that's a low bar."

Then they snuck the ads back in there. Now we have to pay more to get rid of the ads. Oh, and now you have to pay for more features if you want to watch on more than one screen at a time. (2019)"

Color and vibe/feel of virtual remote. Ability to access remote directly as application icon on home screen... With the Device Name as the icon name. That would be an amazing application feat and raise the bar on media consumption for screens. appreciate you Roku! Might even get your speakers soon. Much love from a fan!"

Many games nowadays, and many streaming platforms too, still show ads if you've spent money on the app. Luckily, Netflix doesn't do that. Therefore, I can watch a good series for hours and feel like only 5 minutes has psssed. The recommended shows usually match with what I watch. I personally enjoy the fact that it shows how much a show matches me. Easy to use, nothing complicated at all. Love it⭐"

,"vlad mircan","April 30, 2019",3,"Netflix is too concerned with watch time that they won't let a movie sink in. When it is over they just feed you the next one. Who cares about letting you take some time to think about the experience you've just had? Or to perhaps enjoy the final credit Song? It might seem like a small complaint but it takes me completely out of the feelings of the movie and quickly reminds me that I'm just being spoonfed content. It's a prepaid service after all, how about letting the user have the choice?"

Stop spending big $$ on your own crappy shows no one wants & give us back more content. One more price hike & I'm done with Hulu for good. Barely worth the $12 I pay now for crappy streaming. Not even older series from the 90s available. WAY too many shows are LiveTV only. and your new UI still sucks! DO BETTER"

Online it has my name at the top but if I try to do anything it sends me back to the login screen. I tried to reset my password but it doesn't send me the email when I request it! I can't get ahold of a person to help me all the links send me in circles! I just want to cancel it all at this point so that I'm not charged for a service that I've never even been able to log into!"

,"Jamey Swindler","April 17, 2019",2,"There is a political bias just like every other service you can get today. I start streaming Fox news and it lags, but if I switch to CNN or any other news network it loads just fine. also has no Christian broadcasting. Even Netflix shows Christian movies giving trying to show no bias I'm guessing. Also lost the ability to watch ufc unless I download the ESPN app and watch it on there, which completely kills the convenience I use to like. might be switching soon."

The app lacks the concept of profiles which makes it awkward e.g. when 2 of us are at different places in a box set. It does not recommend titles aligned with my preferences. In general I find it difficult to find something I want to watch on prime. As far as user experience goes, I find Netflix > NowTV > Amazon. Some Amazon shows are good though notably Vikings."

You may have to go to different apps to see the rest of your show, or you might not be able to find it at all. Just please if you are going to put a show on here, please put the whole show on here."
,"April Kruger","April 28, 2019",4,"Here is my most recent review. I really like Hulu but i wish there were a couple more options. It would be great to shut off auto play. I dislike it automatically playing a new series when I reach the end of what I am watching. I also wish there was something like a timer in place for if you accidentally exit out or just touch the screen, (on a touch screen). Every time this happens, I have to rewatch the commercials. It also tend to forget my place, making me search for where I left off."

,"Conall Hanna","April 21, 2019",1,"Rip-off without conscience. Netflix is much cheaper, and comes without additional payments. Everything on netflix is included. Everything worth watching on Prime is an extra surcharge. Even old films. If they're popular, they're not included in the price you pay. If they're terrible and noone wants them, then they're included. Had this for years as it came with the Prime membership, but it's getting worse. I've just searched 7 films in a row, all ages; every single one was an additional charge."

No progress has been made on the issue yet they continue to raise prices and refuse to address the problems with their service or give a time line for resolution.

Unrelated and random content when you click something specific. They go out of their way to make sure there's no way to submit feedback or bugs. Auto play is either completely random or not at all."

,"Porno Lawson","December 30, 2018",1,"The app has constant screen tearing while you're watching a movie on the phone. It buffers at least three or four times a movie when on the same connection I can watch a Netflix movie with no buffering other than to load the movie when I first click on it. When you're scrolling through the menus of different movies from left to right and you click on the movie to find out more about it and then exit back out to the left or right menu again it will start you all over and put you back at the top of the screen so you need to go and scroll all the way back to where you were looking before. And if you're not familiar with star shows and what they're about there's no description in the app to explain what the show is about and what the episode is about. I remember I had so much screen tearing when watching underworld on the Starz app I almost turned off the movie cuz it got so annoying. This is not worth it as it is they have some good movies on there but it's very annoying to watch them."

,"A Google User","March 26, 2019",2,"If you pay extra for the commercial skip and DVR it is not bad, but live TV is horrible.  If you want to watch something that is being recorded it makes it extremely difficult to start from the beginning and does not allow you to skip commercials even when you have enough buffer to skip through them.  Also, while a commercial is playing it won't let you restart or rewind.  Can't sort the DRV, everything appears in random order.  No programming guide.  Too many other basic features that it should have, but doesn't.  It's like the designers have never heard of Tivo.  Update.  I kept waiting for the service to get better, it got much worse.  I was paying extra for no commercials and everything had commercials, no skip, no fast forward.  I went with another service."

Now, you wake your phone, connect to the device (which is slower than before) pass through the home screen, then are allowed back to the remote. Please tell me how this is an update?"

It does have single-play movies, limited to a few amount of famous ones only. So considers you only interested in one-play movies, Netflix is not for you. Personally, I enjoys it. Using experience is pretty decent with smooth transitions, efficient processing and stuffs. Thus, the playing screen on phone doesn't show the full playtime. One minus point."

Hulu forces you to watch the initial ads then the one after intro, one or two more during the show then a last one before credits. Hulu ads ranges from 60sec-90 sec, at minimum you'll be watching about 4min worth of ads on a 20-25min episode. I recommend using other sources for those content."

People spend a little more on Internet to have the bandwidth to stream affordable services like Netflix and Sling, but with their new price hikes it's kind of negating the benefit of cutting the cord with your local cable providers. Their argument will be that they are investing in new original content justifying the price. My argument is who cares. It's about saving money and they've lost touch with a large base of their subscribers. Hopefully these new competing services coming on line will keep that in mind when pricing their offerings."

So I came back on trying to change plan back to what I had. $11 a month with ads. I can't. It says manage accounts but it won't let me change anything. I really miss Hulu. But screw you guys.

Yes, with no wifi you don't need to watch ads to get them, but a get a bunch of ads still even when I don't click on the falling buckets and bombs. And they are ANNOYING.

I'd love to see some improvements. I feel confident that it has nothing to do with my equipment here as I do not have these issues any other time I am streaming.

You can scroll through Roku titles in the app, then launch them directly onto your TV without having to scroll and click with the remote (which is frustratingly slow on my device). Hopefully in the next update, the remote feature will stay connected while a movie is playing so you can pause quickly when needed. Also, would like to be able to cast Netflix titles directly to the TV. Maybe in a future update? Overall, highly recommend!"

If your phone and Roku aren't on the same SID, the app no longer finds it and prevents you from reaching the screen to manually connect. I'll update my review when either of those issues are addressed."

Awesome learning programs for the toddlers, Classic cartoons, not like these lame ass cartoons that they're trying to pass off to the kids today. I've been bragging about this app to anyone who will listen. If I could give it more than 5 stars, I would. And the best part about it is it's free!! I would even be willing to pay for this App."

Impossible to make it through movie. 😒 Otherwise I would rate highest. CAN TUBI PLEASE FIX THIS? And I'm adjusting my review majorly now! ABSOLUTELY LOVE TUBI, how it's arranged and what it has available. And THANK YOU for fixing the freeze issues. Tubi movies have been smooth playing to one's expectations! YAAAAAAAAY!!! Perfect guys,... thank you again. 5 ☆"

,"Sara Lyons","February 17, 2019",1,"100% of the user interface changes are to create MORE difficulty navigating the app. Brightly colored screen is offensive in both brightly lit and dark rooms. Text is overly large, and WHITE against the bright colors makes it hard to read. Navigating is purposely circular in updated UI - clicking on a show will play the first episode, instead of bringing you to the show's page to scroll seasons. Overall, latest changes seem to be an attempt to lose subscriptions. MAKE AN OPTION FOR A DARK THEME."

,"Tom L","April 22, 2019",1,"Terrible app.  For starters it automatically signs you into the account your other amazon apps are using.  Those accounts don't have prime so it's a nuisance. Second there are no profiles, the homescreen shows everything so it's not family friendly.  Yes, there are parental controls, but a lot of these titles I don't even want my kids to see the title/cover, let alone knowing they even exist.  Needless to say, I can't hand my kids the tablet and ask them to find a show. Third, there is no chromecast support.  In order to cast you have to mirror your device's screen.  You can't use that device for anything else while you're watching something, you can't even turn its screen off because that will turn the video off on whatever your casting it to. All in all, if Amazon Prime Video wants to compete with Netflix, then the least they can do is add these very basic features.  I would cancel my netflix in a heartbeat if this app had these things."

Oh, and then the insidious commercials which start out short, then gradually lengthen, eating away at your soul. I signed up because it was a free perk of Spotify Premium service.

People need to read all their options first before selecting. Yes, the option without ads is more expensive but, believe me for few bucks more, I choose that anyday. And is still less then $15 a month. Why not. Cable is way higher. And from all the channels you pay you probably only watch top 3 channels any way and yes many more ads."

When you fall asleep and miss 40 minutes of a show who wants to sit and rewind all the way to the beginning. I need that functionality added on the next update. Thanks!"

So it's deceiving to say that you are only stuck with ads. You are also not privileged to view all they have to offer. Even classics like Everyone Loves Raymond and Law and Order Criminal Intent are locked out."

Spent several hours searching, reading reviews, downloading and installing other apps only to have them not work in some capacity- frustrating! Then, to my relief, i installed tubi and have not had to search any further! Every movie watched has played from start to finish without complications. There are (3/4)short adds during movies yet, comparatively speaking, this is acceptable. i highly recommend tubi!!"

I gave 4 out of 5 because the ads could be better integrated and I saw the same ad three times in a row, but the fact that it's a free service and doesn't have you register is enough to make up for it. Also, the video quality is much better than I expected and I was able to find stuff that I wasn't able to on other streaming services. This app also has less ad breaks and shorter ad times than Hulu and I'm paying for Hulu."

We wish that the layout of Hulu TV was more like an original guide rather than just showing what is currently playing on a channel, i.e. we want to be able to scroll through upcoming content and that does not seem possible through Hulu, only YouTube TV does. We would otherwise switch."

Due to this I feel limited to the shows that I can watch but I am giving leeway becuase Its my first month. Since Hulu live came out did they add a lot more shows to add to live or did they just block off shows and say you have to get live in order to watch it? If you did block of shows, why? Live should be adding live channels not add live and blockingothers"

,"A Google User","April 16, 2019",5,"It does not perform well!!! It's constantly looking to connect to device when it is already connected. It is most frustrating, therefore, it makes it useless to have an app that can replace a remote and be cost effective when it rarely to never works or works right. And what is the use to update what is suppose to better the performance NOT :( HOW SAD!!! If the creator/s of this app can make it finally stand up to its reason for existing than perhaps I would adjust the ratings. Works great now!"

I bought it this month and it'll buffer in the middle of a movie - not a short buffer but - 'am I still connected' kind of buffer.  High speed connection, no issues on other apps, pc etc  I can't get through a movie without buffering."

This app gives you exactly what it says it going to give you and therefore I'm giving it five stars. It's FREE, so quit your belly aching you entitled clowns..."

Better than most alternatives I've tried. 9/17 update--no longer functions at all from any address. Spins the loading/buffering icon endlessly. Occasionally shows 15-20 secs of program then spins again. Had previously rated 4*. Disappointed. Update 4/19. The same caveat regarding use outside U.S. applies. Other probs resolved."

,"Ro Wh","March 15, 2019",1,"first of all there's nothing easy about finding that channel. it's the equivalent of channel surfing one at a time instead of being able to go to a media guide, or search. Why if, you are viewing or listening to a multi-segment program...if you finish segment 1 would it not just start playing the next segment automatically. I understand there are going to be commercials, but it is ridiculous that they come on after only listening to a segment for 3 minutes..and again in 4 min. 👎 i am deleting"
,"Floral & Fire","March 15, 2019",3,"Extremely annoying that NONE of the features they advertise are functional and haven't been for a year. They've received complaints about this MANY MANY times but can't fix it or won't - they removed the option to contact recently too. I'm giving it 3 Stars, they keep an amazing variety of channels. Beyond that? Every feature they advertise is BROKEN on most platforms. Can't favorite channels, can't hide channels, and it logs you out when you close the app."

But again this not a deal breaker. 5* would be the rating I give but the commercial breaks are not in the most opportune places and sometime 2 or 3 run back to back. Again I understand that they are needed to allow the free content, but I have to watch commercials on channels I pay for also on satellite TV. An excellent app! Recommend"

Overall 9/10, room for minor luxury additions without needing to fix or rework anything. All necessities are catered to."

Even if you JUST WATCHED a set of ads from one show, you're forced to watch another set when you switch to a new one. You're also forced to watch a set of ads when you rewind or fast forward too far (again, even if you just watched a set). They should at least limit how often ads can occur. Back to back sets are just ridiculous."

I have to browse for 15 minutes to find the place to contact amazon. still they were giving me more options to cancel membership (which i had already done 10 days ago) instead of writing to them to get my money back. Terrible. I have read such review before starting free trial, but still gave it a go considering they would have fixed the issue."

,"Peter Johannes","March 6, 2019",1,"If you hold down on the screen in skips to that place in the episode. I have never used this feature on purpose and it's really annoying getting back to the place I was if I am moving around and holding my phone by the screen. I can't imagine anyone wanting to use this feature. The feature where you move to places in the episode is also very annoying because there are no images of the scenes so you have to guess. The layout of the app is also very hard to navigate compared to apps like Netflix."

Prior to that, I was experiencing what many people are reporting: that the app was not recognizing the device nor was I even able to log into my account via email.

I used to consider Prime video to be a good supplement to Netflix, but in the last year, it's gone downhill (same as Amazon Music) as Amazon nickel-and-dimes its customers. Much better interface, content, and selection available for less on Netflix, Hulu, Youtube, and HBO."

First, the prices, when I first got Netflix it was $9.99 a month, but now it's $12.99. Second, the movies and shows kind of get boring after a little while. Lastly, the information that cab be taken from it. An example is my friend was using her Netflix account one day, to find out someone had hacked in and was using her Netflix. They even found her card information. That's why I'm giving Netflix 3 stars."

This is why people have stopped using Netflix as much. LUCKILY you have Stranger Things, because, without it, you would be a failing company."

Being in the hospital so much, I wanted an app with new movies that I could watch to pass the time, and since I'm already paying for Starz.....oh well......and please don't tell me to take it up with Spectrum, because they just refer me back to Starz."

I guess, if there is anything annoying it would be the endless commercials. The commercials come in at a rate of 3 at a time. And there are at least 12 to 20 of these advertisements per movie. Now if you can live with that ...its a great movie source. So there you have it."

,"The Dude","April 4, 2019",4,"Hulu is better than Netflix when it comes to price and TV. Mostly because episodes are available the day after they air instead of up to a year or more with Netflix. Another reason being it's much larger and diverse selection of Network TV shows and and Hulu's very own ""Hulu Original's"", However, compared to Netflix, it still has a ways to go with it's movie selection, thus making it more of TV based service."

Some episodes of shows I record end up in the wrong series (at least the franchise is still correct I guess) which means they don't get recorded. Other shows never seem to record at all, despite the fact that there definitely was a new episode that aired. And now I'm getting a generic ""unavailable"" error trying to play back the one show in my DVR that has never given me issues before. This is making me seriously consider paying $50/month more for my old cable package."

Then you have to fast forward to the live cast or back out and come back to the show. It does this often. Also the format for recording is not user friendly. If you add favorite show it will automatically record everything. If you record one episode it will force you to add it to My Stuff. Not enough room for me to explain further my distaste."

If the original Roku remote gets lost with the TV still on, this app will work perfectly. However, if the original remote is lost & there is no on/off physical button on the TV, there is no way to turn the TV on. The app can't recognize the TV unless the TV is on."

Wait another few hours and it's arbitrarily working again. Fun!"

have something paused and to resume playing. That used to disappear when I 
closed the app before, but now it stays there, running, and I'm sure 
draining battery. Not only that, but when I go back to continue watching 
the show later, it hasn't saved my place where I left off. Please fix this 
issue."

Netflix is much better... myself and my family are going back to spectrum the ads ridiculous. ur services use to be good."
,"A Google User","March 11, 2019",1,"If you cancel your free membership before the trail period is complete. The site says you will have access to all programming until the end of the trail billing cycle, even after you cancel. This is incorrect. You will be locked out of all programming and forced to start a new free trail to watch anything. I was interested in possibly doing a subscription but didn't want my CC number locked in just in case I forgot to cancel. I do not recommend using Hulu on a trail bases."
,"A Google User","March 11, 2019",1,"Don't try to pause it come back to what you are watching. Would be great if you could pick what comes on next and it didn't just Auto select I Love Lucy or CSI special victims unit. literally after everything you watch. no matter what you watch it takes the exact same thing every time and there's 500 episodes of CSI special victims unit. so I'm guessing it will never end until you watch all of them. just what you wanted to do after watching one episode a year-and-a-half ago."

Update as of 3.19.2019: I changed my review to 5 stars. A lot of improvements have been made, and is incredibly user friendly!"

,"Chris White","March 19, 2019",5,"i love hulu it's better than Netflix"
,"Angel Dornelly","March 19, 2019",2,"overall the app itself is pretty good, the live tv selections are trash... the free ones anyway and the new update I hate it. I rather hulu open to my lineup instead of hulu picks. If you're going to do an update like that at least give me the option to set up my own layout. Would have given more stars if not for the change."
,"Meghan Scibelli","March 19, 2019",3,"I give them over $40 and still have to deal with constant 3 min ads."
,"grim guise","March 18, 2019",1,"well starting off there is no PIP. if i minimize hulu and go back in i am forced to rewatch 90 second ads over and over. and it is not accurate at all at resuming where i left off. netflix is way beyond hulu in quality of content and app feature. if i could rate hulu below 0 i would. i hate hulu so much. i only keep it around for a few shows. i could bootleg but im not that type. get it together hulu. you charge people money and still run ads. complete trash. edit: still trash"
,"David Jones","March 18, 2019",1,"i pay $45 a month for live version and all i really get is a ton of playback failures thanks hulu ill be cancelling if this keeps up.Problem has gotten worse now hulu shuts off randomly and starts my shows at the end i will cancell this is trash plus no response from support at all.You deserve 0 stars."
,"Shawn Grogan","March 18, 2019",2,"Not Sure About The New Layout, I'll Reevaluate After The Update.... But As Of Now, Since I Can't Find Anything Easily Anymore, and The Fact That The Lineup Disappeared You Get A 2 Right Now... C'mon Get It Together Again, Put Back The Line Up That Shows All The New Episodes That Just Aired The Night Before Like All The Fox Stuff, Like Simpsons, Family Guy, and Bobs Burgers... Ir Put A New Option When Scrolling The Top Where Lineup Was, So That I May See New Episodes Of My Shows as they come out.."

,"A Google User","March 18, 2019",1,"On my trial period right now. im 2 days in and i already hate it. Keeps causing my device to restart and i have to start over again. this app is horrible!!!! Decent shows, but app quality is junk. Fix the bugs or you lose my business and judging by prior reviews, many others as well."
,"dan m","March 18, 2019",3,"App was great untill one of the updates makes it so that if I'm watching multiple episodes of the same show I have to keep switching back to full screen every time. Why keep switching between full screen and 1/4 screen if i choose to watch next episode?. ok so you fixed this. until today 3/18/19. now have to go back and tap in each episode you want to watch. bring back the ""WATCH NOW"" button!!"
,"Gunfu Brizzo","March 18, 2019",1,"not user friendly at all. you just kinda have to deal with it cuz they bend over backwards to stream the best stuff."
,"Sarahb Good","March 18, 2019",5,"i like this app because they have (almost) all of my favorite tv shows and movies and it's cheap but then after a month or two they start sending you great deals and it gets really cheap. i would recommend this app to anyone that just wants to pick a great movie and relax. I LOVE THIS APP. So to anyone that is reading this i highly recommend this to you😊📺🎥"
,"A Google User","March 18, 2019",1,"I am very disappointed in this app. I keep getting kicked off and after watching something I have to start the whole app over again. PLEASE FIX THIS!!!!!"
