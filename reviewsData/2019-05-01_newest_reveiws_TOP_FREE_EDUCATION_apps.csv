I've used it on many devices with different internet speeds. Which leads me to believe it's the app and not connectivity issues."

This doesn't help with keeping the attention of a 2 year old. Performance of this app is not good. Because of that alone, I probably won't be renewing my membership after this trial."

My child's school/teachers send several messages a week, it's so time consuming to try to find an older message without flipping through 30 first. If it's from more than a week ago, forget about it lol. 2, having a way to sync events and dates straight into your calendar. Overall, I enjoy it though."

The reason it's so addictive is because it doesn't patronize it's users. It doesn't include games, but at the same time, it's test feature is more fun than Kahoot, Mobymax, or even Sheppard Software(I still love you, Sheppard Software). I'm still a student and whenever we go over something new in class, I make a Quizlet study set because I know it's effective."

ir down because children would call... which seems like a weak excuse to 
make them unaccesable and continue to charge. The app takes up too much 
space and will in time it will malfunction. I wound up paying $60 by June 
in 2018. I threatened to file a claim with the fcc and they gave me $40

At least, there should be a way to get them back if the test is passed without errors, for example. PS. Too upset with this 'test payment', so keeping only two stars. Upd: And now, new system of points calculation :( The tests became irrelevant, as randomization is limping, the questions are all the same."

Typically, we think of it as the removal of solid particles from a mixture containing both solids and liquids. In this process, we refer to the collected solid material as the residue and the fluid material as the filtrate. Usually, a tool that contains some form of pores is used, which allows the fluid portion, but not the solid portion, to pass through."

There's no reason for it to be in landscape when we're not watching it from that device. We'd love to see this changed in a future update. Thank you."

They are difficult to get in contact with,  only message through their app, no phone number. They say they don't  give refunds they just cancel your subscription a year later.

Had to reinstall to email support, waited for days to get a response and then days again to try and find out what happened. Had to finally call cs to be told they could give me 6 months free to make up for it. Why would I want 6 free months when I never even used it for a day. BE WARNED if they take your information and you choose to cancel, regardless if it was a site problem or not. They WILL not cancel or refund you! Would never recommend!"

If ABCMOUSE isn't going to let Galaxy users use it, then why charge its a big waste & why advertise that it will work, maybe they just dont care to fix it.. I really wanted my child to try this, shows a black screen every time, even after your update."

free is amazing, along with many other titles. I cast this app to the TV 
daily. It runs perfectly! Super easy to use! Full episodes & clips of many 
shows! At first I strongly dislike this app because the episodes would 
never change but the past week the episodes have changed. Just wish Daniel 
Tiger was more known so I can find toys, clothes & books easier. Only show 
my son will go nuts for. 5 Stars from us!"

It runs extremely slow and tends to freeze up not only on a desk top but especially on a tablet/iPad. We actually had this problem 6 years ago when using it for my oldest sons, I just hoped that was no longer the standard. I ended up cancelling before my trial period was over as we could never use it because of the freezing, then deleted the app. I was charged days later (on what would have been the new month) for $9.95 and $3.95. Now trying to redownload the app and figure out what's going on its saying I cannot do so. I cant even access the app and their online customer service is extremely limited. Disappointed years ago and disappointed now."

,"Spencer Cornelson","April 24, 2019",4,"While duolingo offers plenty of information regarding whatever language you choose to leaen, its important to note that some research on your own is required, and the app is a sort of assessment tool to brush up on what you already know. (not entirely the case, they DO have lessons that teach vocabulary and sentence structure.) As it stands, the app itself is invaluable, and im very glad that I chose to download it."
,"A Google User","April 25, 2019",2,"This used to be a good app. While it is still a good app to learn Spanish it takes streaks away so you'll buy repairs.

,"Andrew Greenwood","April 25, 2019",2,"Was a fantastic app until today. They are trying to push you to buy a subscription. This is very irritating as they say it is their mission to bring free language learning to all. Until today you could take a test to level up on a part you were good at to save you hours of grinding. Now if you click to test out it opens a window asking you to pay with the rubies you earned in app or pay cash to buy a subscription. The rubies don't come fast enough so unless you pay you'll be grinding forever."

,"Mr. Magnet","April 25, 2019",5,"Perfectly made to learn the basics of a language. The leaderboard encourages you to do more lessons, and advance to the next league. My advice: 1) Do one skill at a time, and until it is not at 5, don't advance to the next. This way you don't get confused with all the different words. 2) Come back to the old finished skills once in a while, to not forget what you already learned in the past. 3) Don't expect to learn a whole language, but just the basics."

LOL  They do need to change the renewal process to be able to send a payment as soon as it is ready instead of waiting for for it to try and take it.

I wanted and hoped to try the 12 month subscription, but I guess it didn't work out and they charged my card twice. My son just didn't like abcmouse, even though I told him it will help him for pre-k. He didn't care, he said delete it. I requested my money back because I cancelled the next day. I don't know if other people were able to get a refund back, I hope I do! There are a lot of free apps out there or even videos on YouTube that are free and are just as good if not better than this app. I encourage people to look into those first, so your not getting ripped off by their promises they cannot keep!"

When that owl wasn't outside anymore, I ran to my parents room, a message was written on there. ""looks like you missed your spanish lesson today"" written in blood.

The other issue I had is when I am trying to do WORK on my phone I don't want whatever I'm doing being hijacked by this stupid app! I'll be in another app and then this will open up out of nowhere resetting my previous app I was on. 0/10"

,"Chris Hamel","April 27, 2019",5,"Maybe the best app out there. The premium version is unnecessary and doesnt lock you out from content or from practicing extra. The slight game feel to the U.I. is nice, lots of settings to control the experience, and doesnt chew up data. A must have for anyone, especially someone learning a new language from square one.

The only option when this happens is to exit out of the lesson completely and lose your progress. I understand its a free app but that's no excuse for not being able to execute exactly what the app was made for. I would recommend trying other language learning apps before this one."

This was also surprisingly helpful to studying. Spring for the ability to add pics if you're a med student like me. Also the autofinish feature is cool"

,"A Google User","November 2, 2018",5,"I love this app! Where do I start.....ok....It's great to have the contact directly with the teacher! Alongside with seeing and being able to understand what our children are learning and me doing a ""pop quiz"" (that's what I call them) to actually see first hand, is my child listening and on task when he/she is at school. Is my child engaged, are they loving school and then seeing the whole class and the progress is amazing. Oh I almost forgot, uou also have the option if needed to contact the Principle. I can actually say to my child "" it's ok I'm just contacting so and so now (Principles name) to find out what happened"" then suddenly the truth comes out the best part is I am not lying! If I needed to I could contact the Principle and I can show my children! All around a Great app!"

,"Sandra Watson-Brown","November 1, 2018",1,"I do not like this app! I don't like the layout. I don't understand what the 'story' is supposed to be. I don't understand why I get notifications that there's something to look at, but then the notifications aren't in 'notifications' when I click there. It makes no sense that when I click on 'messages' I'll see only one message, but when I click on that one message, every message ever sent is in there with it and I'm immediately shown a reply box before I can even read the new message. I really do not like the concept of the points system at all!!! And what's the sense in having that data if it's only there for a week anyway? I think teachers are wasting their time with these apps. We have Agendas for notes between home and school, and pictures can be posted to Twitter - we don't need additional apps in my view. I would not recommend this app and I may very well get rid of it. A previous teacher used Remind and it was far better."

Also whenever I finish a lesson I have to click through WAY too many pop ups for rewards (multiple rewards each time), progress trackers, adverts and upgrade prompts. Finally, so many great services offered on the website, like skill notes, don't exist on the app."

If specific shows can't be on there for certain reasons the ability to access more complete episodes of what can be on there would be so awesome. It's an awesome app overall.

I pay money to ABC mouse because I don't want ads or inappropriate content like some other children's free apps have. ABC mouse does not do that however their agreement does say they collect and share cookies and info from your phone, browsing content and child's progress with third party providers. I'm anti govt regulation however I'm getting to a point where these companies are invading way too far into our devices privacy and collecting too much personal information that does not revolve around the direct use of the application. I don't mind if mouse is using data to assist my kid through lessons but they have no business collecting info off my phone. I'm ready for regulation to end practices like this."
,"Eric S","August 30, 2018",2,"For a yearly fee you'd think the UI would be better. The UI is extremely clunky. Feels like its 10 years old. Also, my children are uninterested in the content. Make this more fun to use so I don't feel like I'm just wasting my money."

My only complaint is that whenever my child's teacher sends me a message, the notification for it shows me every message she's ever sent me in one long notification, starting with the very first one. This is so, sooo annoying & it's inconvenient not to be able to quick-view the new received message at a glance before opening the app. LG Stylo 4."

At $9.95+++/month, it doesn't sound very free to me. I have no problem with paying for apps, but $10/month or more is a lot for an app that my baby is still quite young to grasp (she's only a year). I just don't like how it's claiming to be to be a free app but they don't even have one thing you can do once in the app itself without paying for."
,"Dick Soberman","February 27, 2018",1,"Asked to download by a shady source, one of those gift card offers, they make you give your credit card and don't make it easy at all to unsubscribe.  The unsubscribe link in email only unsubscribes you from communication, forcing you to redownload the app if you deleted it.  I forgot my password and have yet to receive an email giving me options to  choose a new one, blocking me from access to the app which allows me to unsubscribe and not be billed month to month.  Scam."

,"Original Jester","February 27, 2018",1,"It says it's Free, but upon opening the app for the first time, the entire starting page is one big scam app, making your only option you have to click is an Ad that, upon closing, takes you to a sign up page that requires a credit card in order to let you access the app. That's it. If you're like me and don't use credit cards, your child is out of luck. Do NOT be fooled, this is NOT free - unless you provide a credit card number first. If you don't have one, you cannot hope to access anything ever. Period. Abc mouse, I understand you give 30 days free, but you should not falsely advertise the entire app is free if you make people give a credit card number just to get past the endless Ad on the opening page. I wonder how many people have wasted data because they never knew they needed a credit card first. You as a company have so much money already. You can afford a Free, smaller version of the expensive desktop app you also make everyone already pay for."

,"Jacob Schouten","April 29, 2019",3,"Should be advertised as practice. This is not good for ""teaching a language"", since it doesn't really teach about why things are the way they are, or how the language works. It just gives charcters/letters, words, or phrases to practice. It is good for practice on top of a normal language education, not as it's own classes."

,"Limey Shades","April 29, 2019",4,"While yes, it's actually really a good resource to get the basics and extra vocabulary, the problem is you probably can't have a full conversation with just Duolingo experience. That doesn't mean its a bad app, just that you shouldn't expect to be fluent by the end. It also doesn't explain conjugations or specifics and hopes you learn on your own. Overall it's very user friendly with a really clean and simple UI with eazy to navigate menus. It's a good app."

It is worth mentioning that there is misinformation to some degree, but like learning anything, it can be helpful to learn from mutliple sources, not just Duo. If you want to learn a language, maybe this app will make you want to take it seriously. Oh and you can learn High Valyrian, so 5/5."

I sent an email to feedback but have not got a response. I believe this was deliberate because the app kept telling me to buy premium to restore by streak. I HAD though about purchasing premium in the future when I can afford it. I was enjoying this app and would like to support it. But if you are going to play these sort of games to make people buy premium, then I don't want this app"

The short (maximum: 5 minutes) lessons with good quality overall and cute images too. The audio is good but can become better (in Spanish). The audio just becomes inaudible sometimes and too loud other times... But still, I love it! 😀"

,"Mariah","April 28, 2019",4,"I think this app is great for beginners and people who want to start learning a language. However, I personally think you shouldn't rely on just this app to learn a language. I generally use this app for supplemental learning or to reinforce what I've already learned with a language, which is why I give it a high rating. I think it's more beneficial when you have some prior knowledge of the language. It's still a really great tool, especially since it's free."

They want that commitment to the subscription before you do anything. The ""one month free"" requires a credit card number to get started. No thanks.

,"Spiralynx","December 11, 2018",3,"I dont like how you get more points for answering faster, and slower at answering you are, less points. I also dont like that since you get more points by answering faster, students usually try to answer as fast as possible, which could cause them to accidentally pick the wrong answer because of reflexes, or they read an answer quickly and misread it. Sometimes the students will notice that they picked the wrong one because said problems, and they have no way of reversing it. Overall I think it is a good app but it lacks fairness and the way of correction."

already in early intervention and a teacher from headstart also comes out 
to teach him and his one year old baby sister anyways, he already has a 
hard time sitting still for five minutes at a time to learn anything and 
has a communication delay right now as well, the loading issue would 
frustrate him really bad, also I'm not downloading it or trying the free 
trial subscription either bcuz I'm not taking money away from my children 
just for a stupid app that obviously has all kinds of errors and loading 
issues and won't let you unsubscribe and steals your money, money to which 
we could pay for other ways of education for them that actually works the 
way it's meant to work! So SORRY BUT NOT SORRY I WON'T BE DOWNLOADING YOUR 
B**L S**T APP AND WASTING MY CHILDREN'S TIME AND MONEY! THIS APP AND 
CORPORATION ISN'T TAKING MY CHILDREN'S EDUCATIONAL FUNDS FROM THEM AND 
GIVING THEM NOTHING IN RETURN! A BIG THANKS FOR THE PARENTS THAT HAPPEN TO 
TELL EVERY ONE EXACTLY WHAT THIS APP WAS DOING TO US! AND I DON'T SHARE 
NONE OF THE INFORMATION THIS APP WAS ASKING FOR TO ANYONE!!!! INVASION OF 
PRIVACY IS RIGHT GUYS AND ITS ALSO ILLEGAL TO KEEP A PERSONS DEBIT CARD ON 
FILE AFTER THEY HAVE ENDED THEIR SUBSCRIPTION AND KEEP CHARGING THEM FOR AN 
ACCOUNT THEY NO LONGER USE THIS SITE IS LUCKY THEY HAVEN'T HAD A LAWSUIT 
FILED AGAINST THEM YET!!!???🤔🙄😒😡😠😤👎👎👊👊 SHAME ON YOU FOR USING 
CHILDREN, PROMISING THEM SOMETHING FUN AND NOT DOING IT JUST SO YOU CAN 
MAKE EXTRA MONEY! FIR SHAME!!!!"

my kids lived it. Customer service and billing, however, not so much. We 
hadn't used it in months as my kids are getting older and I didn't realize 
my bill was coming due. Usually a recurring service will notify you before 
billing you. This is not the case with ABC mouse. I realized they debited 
my account and contacted them the same day to request a refund as we 
haven't even logged in to the service for months and they would not budge. 
I've been in customer service for 11 years and have had excellent 
experiences with Amazon so I was very disappointed with the attitude of the 
company for this product."

I do most of my studying at night, and it ruins your sleep if you look at a bright screen before sleeping. Night mode should be a regular feature for those that study best before bed. Now I barely use this app, and try to use audio learning at night (like language transfer)"

The only educational app that has ever worked for me would 100% recommend!"

Also, the US Social Work study contains content on US laws and services that do not exist in Canada and are therefore irrelevant. Is there a CDN version in the works? Other than that, it is great!"

But luckily it's only to get rid of the ads, which aren't really a issue in my opinion. You finish a lesson and then it gives a short ad to look at, then you close it. 11/10"

My only recommendation would be to have less levels - I do Spanish lessons at school as well and when I did the test I was surprised there are so many levels for basic that it gets boring. I already knew the vocabulary and having to repeat it so much was annoying. Plus, my keyboard doesn't do accents, so I would appreciate a side one with the accented letters.Really great though, love the app keep it up!"

Long math problems can't fit, because the scanner can't read multiple lines. I wish it could do this, because sometimes I can't tell if it's multiplication, more than one operation, etc. I reccomend this app to check your work, because it cannot solve big problems or word problems.

Recently (or maybe not) an update has changed it so I can no longer use the app at all, as I have no access to internet. If I can't afford internet I certainly cannot afford offline training."

The activities aren't challenging and are repetitive.  As far as having it as an app on your mobile device it's a waste of money and space.

the app that I signed up for a free trial and got charged 21 bucks for. He 
will not stay on it longer than five minutes. I cannot cancel the 
membership because it goes to a blank white square with a blue border, 
whether we use his tablet, a phone or desktop. He seems to learn more 
watching YouTube videos, maybe because they use real children and real toys 
(he likes cars) to help him learn. And YouTube red is cheaper than ABC 
mouse and works just fine. Please cancel my free (paid membership) trial.

,"X-01 76","April 30, 2019",3,"The app itself is decent. The good: Easy to use UI, simple design, clear pronunciation (for French at least), and a nice competitive leaderboard. The Bad: Your words dont always register, sometimes audio doesnt play at all, theres a lack of actual teaching, terrible explanations half the time, and not much on grammar lessons. The app is really only going to be maximized by its users if they use it while taking an actual language class. It is not a standalone language learning app."

I was trying to learn a new languge other than French, and I accidentally tapped on (Francais -To - Anglais) So now the app is stuck in French when I can only understand Cat and Dog in that languge, I have no idea how to change it back, This is making me very upset.

And at times, the translations are more than questionable. But there's that annoying cartoon owl (?) with trite comments. Not exactly motivational."

,"A Google User","March 9, 2019",2,"Not possible to edit the card during ""Learning"" mode. When you open the set, you have an option to view the cards in alphabetical order, but if you need to edit one card you have to edit the whole set and an option ""alphabetical order"" dissapears in ""edit"" mode. If there are more than 20 words in the set you need to spend a lot of time for searching the word you want to edit. ""Add a new word"" is at the end of the list, so if the list is more than 20 words that's super uncomfortable."

Verb conjugation, a vital part of any language, isn't explained at the beginning of a lesson. It is in the lightbulb at the top, but doesn't include the nosotras, ellas, or vosotras forms, which makes it frustrating for a beginning learners to figure out. However, overall the app is very helpful with pronunciation and understanding sentence structure."

The only thing I would suggest to improve is to incorporate a section in the early lessons for grammar rules. With Italian, the same English word can have two versions. It's difficult to understand which to use when there isn't a way to learn when to use each version. Cracking this early will make learning easier later. Keep it up! Highly recommend."

I'm experiencing technical issues like lags and it gets unresponsive at times. A must have app for anyone who is interested in languages. 11/10 would definitely recommend."

,"Ludde Algell","September 8, 2018",1,"Perhaps our expectations were set too high that we could buy an app that replaced all the add supported apps out there. The main problem is that the app is painfully slow in every and all aspect. Launching takes time which perhaps would have been ok. But even inside the app everything comes to a halt. To teach the alphabet you would have different pictures but even going from an Apple to a Banan there is like a 5 second delay which is super frustrating. Already been in contact with the support team and apparently there is no plan to improve the app. Also note that if you don't have a very quick and stable broadband connection the app will not work. So forget using it during car/plane trips. There is some apps that could be downloaded for offline but not these are subpar. If they invested some money into the app maybe it could work better."

Let me tell you our son was 2 when we got the app and he is 7 now. Top reader in his kindergarten 1st and we are looking to see the results for second grade. When he was in pre school he had shocked us by reading at I believe it was 2 1/2 years old. We was told he is on the autism spectrum since he was 2 years old but thank you and mouse for finding that loving to learn bug in him."
,"A Google User","September 6, 2018",1,"Imagine as an adult wanting to supplement your education by taking an extra math course. The first 4 weeks consist of the basics of addition and subtraction. That's what this program is similar too, it assumes, based on age, every child has progressed only to a certain level. There are several improvements which can be made but the first should be an introductory course to match individual child's level of understanding to relevent and challenging content which pushes as well as affirms successful progress. Also, this app fails to allow access across platforms, you sign up on iOS and need to cancel via iOS, you won't be able to log in via web browsers to cancel the account. I'm sure this app can be useful, but I think the ""success"" stories seen on TV and arguably in these reviews about kids loving the app is derived more from the ability to spend time on a fancy electronic device and the colorful, multiple items to interact with rather than building and supporting an enjoyment for learning school work. This is an app for kids who might fall behind in their schoolwork to allow reinforcement of material they might struggle with rather than a kid who is, according to this app, much more advanced than the ""typical"" or ""general"" whatever age group they fall in. To rebrand the quote in the above picture ""accelerates growth away from literacy and math afterschool tutor bills""."

,"A Google User","March 15, 2019",1,"I don't like the new design. I preferred having the ""create a new set"" as a widget. The design also has a higher emphasis on using other peoples flashcards and buying flashcards. I despise this.

,"A Google User","February 4, 2019",5,"Amazing. I loved it because it helped me study for my prokaryotic cells and eukaryotic cells test, including my most recent one: which is Far-East China and the Mongol Civilization. Quizlet is really handy when you can't memorize anything so it makes the job more fun and easier to memorize. It makes me feel good about my test, and I even got an A on the Prokaryote and Eukoryote tests. I would like to say thank you to quizlet, it is really simple and the interface is easy to understand."

The mixed format of lessons definitely has helped with my ear, when my auditory deciphering skills in even English are pretty sub-par. That said, the de-emphasis of conjugation cripples the learning process, and the spaced vocabulary repetition isn't all it's cracked up to be. (Omg, I know how ro say ""cow"" already!!!) The fact that it's available for free, however, lets me forgive a lot."

So, in general, there are a few bugs, some mistakes, but other than that, it's a really good app to learn a new language and I will recommend it to others. Just fix the bugs please."

I contacted ABCMouse about this to again cancel, and to request a refund of those months of inappropriately billing. Not surprised that they ignored the request for refund, but they apparently ignored the 2nd cancellation, and continued to bill monthly. This was many months ago, if not years."

,"Richard J. Barbalace","February 21, 2019",2,"This app is frustrating for parents.  Some of the frustration comes from teachers not using the app well (more training for teachers could help with that), including things like spamming the whole school with notifications relevant only for their classroom, lack of use and lack of student feedback by teachers, no meaning to the points (+1, -1) or why they were given, etc.  The UI for the app is already really frustrating.  The login requires typing in my long email address and long password, which is infuriating, instead of allowing me to paste them in from my password manager.  UX designers should never do this because it creates a barrier to using strong unique passwords and a password manager.  Navigation in the app is also tedious - to see how my child performed this week, I have to click on the Reports button, click on my child (I've only one, so can't it default to that?),  click on View report (isn't that what i'm trying to do already!), see nothing for today, click on the calendar icon, and click on weekly.  That's 5 clicks with slow refreshes that should require a single click.  App also logs out silently, so no messages or notifications come in."

Points from the app don't always show up and when they finally do, 4 or more show up at a time, with the same time stamp. There was always a weird glitch that I couldn't go to comments from the point screen, I'd have to go to class story or toolkit first. The final straw was trying to reset the points and only getting a loading screen."

,"Sofia Pleat","April 24, 2019",5,"It is good but it has some problems. It is really anoying but it helps you with the language's that you are trying to learn. When there are adds it says you can skip it after 30 seconds or 20 seconds but you can't skip it at all and the adds are from 10 to 20 minutes or longer. When ever I try to press something it always says I am rong when I haven't even pressed anything and it glitches and freezing and says to wait one minute and I do but it takes an hour for it to stop freezing and gliching."

He can just tap it and it will automatically go where it's supposed to. The purpose of a puzzle is to challenge them. This doesn't do that. I wanted to love this but I'll be canceling."

,"Raphael Piazzarollo Loureiro","April 23, 2019",3,"The streak repair ad is really annoying. Please remove it in the plus version. The app is coherent and the teaching really works if you practice daily. The problems: it crashes a lot and despite paying for the ""plus"" service, which should give us access to the lessons even while off-line (e.g. in the subway), many times while off-line, I receive the message that the lesson is not yet available. Please let the app buffer more lessons in advance or let us manage the downloads. Thanks!"
,"Ernie M","April 23, 2019",5,"So far my experience with this app has been positive. It has a good focus on memory based learning and feels convenient and easy. Learning a new language is a valuable skill, and to be able to learn for free is awesome. Also, the memes are great."

I have clicked on every possible button i cam find in the app to try and remove this school or at the very least turn off the notifocations for JUST that school and thr only option i have is turning off the notifications as a whole. I have even went into your help section to see if i was missing something and guess what the steps that it tells me to do to remove the school is for andrpid users i am to click on the 3 lines in the upper left hand corner....but there is NO 3 lines in my upper left hand corner! I even checked to make sure that my app was updated AND it is! Other then THIS the app is great. I will not give it any more then 2 stars until that option is FIXED!!!"

Had I have not been listening, I wouldn't have heard the song about how basically to be a big kid is to be a bully and have an attitude.

,"Finby Oasta","April 30, 2019",1,"Since the last update, Duolingo has just been a mangled corpse of its former glory. Skipping levels is less rewarding in terms of xp gain than doing individual lessons. And if you want to maximise how much xp you gain, you'd be hurting your learning because each lesson only has a few sets of sentences that are monotonously repeated over to be completed like work in school. It curbs your learning and makes you feel unmotivated to learn. Duo, fix your app because people will go to alternatives."

,"Kole Wasden","April 30, 2019",5,"I am in the middle of learning Norwiegian, and i am happy to say the amount of lessons there are is astonishing. They are more like a tutor than a teacher, they focus on you rather than a class as a whole. They make sure you have the right answer before you advance ""Levels"" letting you know if there are typos or not, thus teaching YOU the mistake you made, making it easier to learn the correct way to speak. Very helpful with learning the language of my ancestors. A+ from me!!!"

,"Vandal Noire","April 30, 2019",3,"This app is great for learning to read a language that uses familiar letters such as spanish, german and so on for english speakers but not for speaking those languages as the product has few speach excersises. Howevere where this product falls flat is when trying to learn anything that does not have those letters. Japanese, Hebrew, Russian, Chinese ect as the first leasons focus on reading a script that is so alien to western eyes that you will quickly give up,"

,"Gabrielle McCoy","April 30, 2019",3,"Children learn language verbally first, and then they learn the letters that correspond to the sounds they make, and then they learn how those letters form words Adults have to do it differently We learn the letters and sounds first, and then we learn how the sound in words, and how they form sentences Duolingo is obviously geared (lesson wise) towards children. However it is designed for adults and its just a poor experience for anything that doesn't have Latin Letters I am keeping it for now.."

You dont have to type it in and get a step by step explanation"

,"Dr. Nandkumar Kamat","December 7, 2018",5,"This is an app as important as library of Alexandria once was for educating mankind. Google deserves the NOBEL PEACE PRIZE for democratizing education. Its iberating force for teachers in poor underdeveloped Anglophone and esp member countries of British commonwealth. But if offered in other languages like Chinese, Arabic, Swahili, Persian, Hindi, Urdu, Tamil, Marathi, Telugu, Bangla, Gujarathi, Punjabi then it can be used very effectively and bring billions under its use. Its free , simple to use and Outstanding teaching app but restricted by limit of 20 files which can be attached with any post. Doesnt make any sense. Please increase to min 50 files."

Even tho after the new update you erased everyone's progress, now you don't even allow people to progress faster without paying. Level 4 and 5 have 25 lessons and I'm a working adult who don't have time to finish all that, that's why I always test out when I understand enough. I 'm still regularly using it, but I'm gonna test out other languages app too and eventually I'll uninstall this app."

The option to turn on/off auto play would be nice. As it is now an episode starts as soon as the preceding ends. Ability to create a playlist or favorites would be awesome as well. I let my kid watch 1 episode of Daniel Tiger and then 1 episode of Sesame Street before nap. Would be great if I could set them up to play instead of switching around."

,"Sabrina Dollar","July 7, 2018",1,"I was hoping this was a great reading tool for my son with Dyslexia. I 
found out quickly that when he ""read"" the books, he was really fast 
forwarding through them and it was giving him credit for reading the book. 
So there is not way to be sure he truly read anything. There is no small 
assessment at the end of each book either. If you have a smart child who 
knows how to cheat the system this app is not for you."

books not always working. My son loves to watch the music videos and they 
haven't been working. I don't know that I'll be paying for this if this 
continues. It's sad to have a sad kid who hopes to watch these videos or 
books at bedtime and can't. He can't even pass the current level just 
because videos aren't playing. This is a 5 star app but with this issue 
it's not. It's a big problem when you can't move forward."
,"Jihae Song","July 7, 2018",1,"Worst paid app ever made... Super laggy and its just poorly made. They have 
so much commercial on tv... it is very luring and I did sign up for 1 year 
and come to the conclusion my kids only wanted tickets to buy hamster and 
play with it. Their lesson plan sucks. And kids got bored after using for a 
month due to lagginess and nothing fun. Its always singing, videos, 
coloring... samething over and over... there is a pizzle that always goes 
back to level 0 when my child should be on level 3. Its sooo much time 
consuming trying to get it to work! seriously... those 5 star probably fake 
reviews.. I had kept changing levels for 2 of my kids and they literally 
learned nothing... stay away from it."

Tried the app feedback site, but it is pointless since I have this app on different devices - and it performs the same on each platform. The biggest glitch I hate is when he has completed an activity, but it doesn't go back to start another one. It stays on it forever until we have to close it out. This is now an everyday thing. Uninstalling and reinstalling doesn't help at all. This app feels like its underdeveloped."

,"Jaime McCoin","April 27, 2019",5,"I took 4 years of Spanish classes in high school, but feel like I learned more going through the entirety of Duo Lingo's Spanish course (over about a year time span) than in all of my school years. Doing just the lessons won't get you to full fluency mostly because you need to practice listening and speaking to have real conversation skills, but they've added other features that help improve listening comprehension which is cool. For a totally free app, it's really excellent."

The quality and content of the apps are their with wonderful bright graphics and educational and fun material, but installing as the constant upselling and pop ups are too much and neverending. Even if you purchase additional songs or material for your app, you will still bombarding your users and customers with new things to buy each and every time they open the app. I've taken a loss in past purchases that weren't restored after deleting the app due to space. This combined with all I have said above is too much and unfortunately makes this app just not worth the aggravation."

If I'm learning a language, I need to know how the grammar works. I can't imagine how they can not put such a useful feature in the app. Seriously I don't think it would be super complicated feature to implement. Developers please, if you're reading it, do take it into consideration. It is very very helpful in understanding the structure of the language."
,"Justine Claire Daet","April 23, 2019",2,"I'm a long-time Duolingo user. I've loved this app because I got to discover my love to languages through it. For years I've never had complaints, until now. Why are you now asking us to pay to skip tests? Yes, we know that we've stacked up lingots through lessons, but if you're going to ask for 5 LINGOTS, per test, with the risk of losing the lingots because you didn't pass, is simply unfair. Either lessen the lingot pay or remove it completely.."

It's especially gauling when the tests freeze FREQUENTLY, meaning that you've spent 5 lingots for nothing. You guys are RUINING your own app for money and it's obscenely transparent."

The mobile app also doesn't have what I consider to be one of the most useful features of the site: the grammar tips section, which clarifies the new grammatical rules you need for each section."

,"Thepurplekirin Kirin","April 27, 2019",5,"I love this app and here a few reasons why -- 1 it's an easy app to use and understand -- 2 it simple but effective -- 3 and most importantly it free, free to use, free to learn -- I personally think that we need more apps like this so that people with low or no income can learn and hopeful be able to apply the things they learn to their life like jobs or travel or maybe even understand love ones that don't speak the same language"

The last thing I need are frustrated kids.  Do not get this app.  Avoid it if you can.  The app has a horrible interface.  It doesn't know what was your last video or what you have already watched.  I grew up on PBS but this app really doesn't work well at all.  Finding a new video from a series is difficult. I end up watching the same video over and over"

,"Spencer Cornelson","April 24, 2019",4,"While duolingo offers plenty of information regarding whatever language you choose to leaen, its important to note that some research on your own is required, and the app is a sort of assessment tool to brush up on what you already know. (not entirely the case, they DO have lessons that teach vocabulary and sentence structure.) As it stands, the app itself is invaluable, and im very glad that I chose to download it."

It's worth it though because I now know what ""finger"" is in Spanish. CINCO DEDOS CUATRO DEDOS TRES DEDOS DOS DEDOS UN DEDO NO DEDO! CINCO ESTRELLAS. MUY BIEN."

It's learning made easy and fun, definitely stimulating - totally unlike the experience I had in middle school Russian class. And the lessons stick."

,"aldi mill susanto","May 1, 2019",4,"I like how you improve duolingo until this far, with many courses and some unique courses to be provided. But the rigor of learning can be hightened by using more similar verbs or nouns in word choices to remind us there are such rules and grammars. Furthermore, i hope there is a reminder when we answer incorrectly. For example, you can add light bulb symbol to remark which part of lesson you want to show through some questions. I hope the listening part may also include responding questions."

Based on all this I would give it 5 stars, but for me there is one major drawback. Every time I haven't been able to use the app for a while I start back from 0 which is boring and doesn't contribute to my learning experience. Due to this I would suggest to add a test to assess the level of the user when they continue after taking a break."

it as much as your children. Kids in turn will feel more enthusiastic to 
open the app if they have a parent's to sit on and share the content with, 
rather being left to their devices to do this thing alone. Then again I 
suppose it all depends on the child as well. My Grand daughters loves it, 
because they can always go to father and do the games with him and he's 
just as enthused to sit with them and play... it becomes a game to all of 
them."

What I don't like about the app is that when stopping the video and getting out of the app. The videos play in the background while your on your main screen of the phone. App needs an update or a stop button so video doesn't sound off when you're not in it. I sometimes have to delete the app and re-download it because as many times as you stop the video you're going back into the app to pause it again."

,"Grace Blair","April 8, 2019",4,"This app has been so beneficial when it comes to parent communication. The only downside is that your messages are limited in characters when sending a group message. This makes it a bit harder to send longer messages. A great development would be an auto split of the message you type into the appropriate sizes, rather than having to try and split the message yourself."

I cant even tell which email I used as when I log in my regular email it says that I don't have any subscription. Also, free trail comes with payment and good luck cancelling once you paid as you will get 10 to 15 screens negotiating for lower price. Even after cancelling,I advise you to watch your credit cards for payments posted. My daughter was so facinated by their ads on TV but its actual a crappy app"

In the middle of a game or activity it will kick them off or at the end of their learning path when they are picking an award. They get extremely frustrated because in about a 15 minute period it has crashed for my 7 year old 4 times."

Other than freezing I've noticed some things that look like they are part of the app send you to download another. I'm not sure if that's just because of how my daughter got to it or if it's just open somewhere in the app. Love the app over all it has helped with preschool and its helping my 2nd grader a little bit too"

,"Zayn Eve Dinsmore","April 29, 2019",1,"Suggestion: ADD PRONUNCUATION GUIDES I'm trying to learn Hebrew and since Duolingo is free, I though I would start here. While I like the idea of the app, it is RIDICULOUSLY hard to follow along and LEARN anything with the current set up for Hebrew. It is REALLY hard to hear how words and sentences are pronounced, and there is no alphabet guide to help figure it out. You'll basically need to find a flashcard app to use in conjunction, which make this app more clunky and unnecessary than useful."

This needs to be changed ASAP. Are people suppose to automatically know how to pronounce the words in Irish? Because anybody who even has a beginner knowledge of the language knows that the words sound completely different from how they are spelled. FIX IT."

Only issue, the cast button seems to be missing from the current version on the google play store (2.5.1). (I tried rebooting my router, and did a factory reset of my chromecast with no success, so I think the problem is with this version of the app.) Letting both kids watch from my phone isn't really practical, so without a way to cast to the TV,  the app doesn't work for us.   If this one detail could be resolved, I would cancel my netflix subscription, and give this app 6 stars!  Really, it's hard to complain with a free app, that is otherwise fantastic.  EDIT:  Some how the cast button is magically there now. Not sure what happened, but it's working great and my kids love it! 6 stars!"

They would tap a button, swipe a key or mistakingly  press buttons that would take them out of their choice episode. I finally realized the improvement this App needed is an ""In-App"" LOCK function to allow kids to watch their shows uninterrupted - even if they swipe, thumb press, mistap or drop the device, it will stay put.

,"A Google User","February 12, 2018",1,"Respose for PBS Kids: I have tried the factory reset and have been left with an app that sort of functions with content that doesn't change. PBS Kids app on our Roku seems to function better now. As a parent I still do not approve of the auto-play function that can't be turned off. I am also disappointed that a tablet made for PBS can't support the PBS app.  Updated Review: this app no longer works on my PBS Kids tablet no matter how many updates I do. The addition of the Watch Live feature was the downfall of what used to be a great app for my kids.  Before the addition of being able to watch the Live Stream this app was a 5 star review. Since the update the app no longer loads. I ended up doing a factory reset and declining the update so that we could still use the app. The Roku version of this app has similar problems since the update. It would be nice if the program could support the Live Stream but it cannot. Another request would be to turn off auto play. The shows will just play one after another which becomes an argument with my child when I tell him to only watch one show. Blocking certain shows would be nice as well, because we don't allow Caillou in our house."

Upon semester switch, I was able to seamlessly move students to the different hours. It would be nice if we could ""change student name"" more than once. Urban phone exchanges."

scam before paying for whole year. Please do your homework and there are 
tons of better option out there. I happily donated to few free apps to 
support the developers because my son was using and learning from those 
apps. Old: Please fix it. App keeps crashing on kindle fire when loading

working app.I didn't pay for full year to get an app that my child can't 
use. Paid till April 25,2019. Used only for few weeks. Looks like they

So if I do something like hand the clothes I get points and the person that gets the most point after the end of the week your parent might buy you something you want maybe you got 20 point you might get something for $20/€20/¢20/¥20/£20.

This app can process pretty much any equation you throw at it, I haven't yet found one equation this app can't solve. The BIG thing about this particular calculator isn't necessarily the fact that it can read handwriting (which is very cool too), rather that this app explains every single step to your equation and what to do and even shows multiple ways to solve your equations. 10/10 would download again."

The only thing that could make quizlet better, in my opinion, is to expand the number of vocab words that appear in any one ""matching"" game. But that might be a matter of screen size. If you are learning a new language, need to master a restaurant menu, or taking vocab-heavy courses, I think you should buy the quizlet premium membership. It is totally worth unlimited vocab studying sessions!"

She was able to push the buttons but not much more, that was my fault for signing up for it too early. Needless to say, we cancelled until just today. My little one was so excited to play!! The issue is, she had tickets from our prior subscription and was ecstatic to buy a frong with her tickets. We attempted to go to the Pet Park and it keeps freezing or just doesn't work. We're canceling!!"
,"Jenlanell Thomas","March 13, 2019",2,"My daughter is 2 and I just started Abc mouse with her. Right off the back i notice some things that use improvement. Like first in formost you need to change the interface for the younger children and filter the games for the appropriate age. Also have a child lock on it so my child can color and I dont have worry about her exiting the app. This app seems like it caters to older children. I'm thinking about deleting it and possibly reinstalling in a few years."

When it says you are at 100% you will crush that subject material. Oh and it will bug you with notification emails to take just a few minutes to practice as it counts down to your test date."

Mouse set up on a different device for each child, with their own learning 
path and personal profile. The children would love to be able to open the 
application, and play the games, any time they wanted to...and they would, 
if I didn't have to log out of the kid safe mode and into ABC Mouse EVER 
SINGLE TIME my granddaughters want to play with this game... And if all 
three girls would actually show as ""users"" to play the games, and if the 
technical support team actually listened to my concerns instead of sending 
me blanket ""fix""e-mail that didn't come close to answering my questions and 
addressing my concerns, maybe I wouldn't hate this app so much...but as it 
is, ABC Mouse is a pain in the butt to use. Unless your kids are happy 
listening to the ABC Mouse advertisement over and over again, and if one 
child doesn't mind never having her name show up on the player list, and 
therefore never getting any ""tickets"" for her play time, then maybe ABC 
Mouse would be worth the rediculious price...but until somebody can take 
the time to address my concerns and help me to correct the problem, ABC 
Mouse sucks."

Frequently, when I go to message an individual parent, after searching for their name and clicking on it, it takes me to the wrong parent. This is very frustrating because it lends itself to me sending a confidential message to the wrong parent. I have tried deleting and reinstalling the app with no success. It's just not very convenient to have an app that doesn't work properly."

Bought a year as a present, then got billed automatically for a full second year when I thought our subscription was FINALLY over, no warning, no reminder, just auto debit a year after the fact. No phone number, no chat feature. The ONLY way to reach customer service is to email and hope they get back to you. My hope of getting my money returned and getting out of a full year of an unwanted app are slim."

The only time I have seen people that represent me and my family, they are singing and dancing as if we don't have favorite colors or favorite things or are capable of being in just a normal story about colors or numbers.

,"Michael James Mckey","April 27, 2019",5,"The app has a large user base(not just on android but other operating systems such as ios and windows) which provide many public learning resources on a wide range of sudjects which saves valuable study time. There used to be glitches where the app would crash as various times but all of these problems have been patched. The struture has also changed to give a better learning experience(e.g. Incorrect pairs are now faded so that correlations are not created between incorrect pairs)."

Don't tell me to just get in contact with you, ABCMouse. This will only get fixed by hiring better programmers. edit: lowering review even further. Unbelievably buggy, freezes constantly.

As well as for them to expand this to all school ages. I do believe my older children could benefit from this app and do better in school if they expand it to there all school ages."
,"A Google User","September 20, 2018",2,"Problem 1 is you have to do the lessons in order with very little flexibility if your kid doesn't feel like singing songs or poking different colors on the screen just now. There's no ability to skip from one lesson to another, YOU WILL FOLLOW THE LEARNING PATH. Pages take too long to load and often get hung up clocking. At one point we couldn't progress past a particular exercise, no matter what we did. Thanks for the meltdown this caused. Using the latest model Samsung phone and tablets. I have buyers remorse and wish I hadn't spent the money for this."

They made it so complex and built it so poorly that it's very difficult to navigate, it loads terribly slowly, and it often freezes or some aspects don't work. There is no ""home"" button within activities, so you have to go through possibly dozens of slowly loading pages to get to what you want. I'm considering getting a refund. (The app is free but the service is not, and if the app doesn't work then the program is useless)."

,"A Google User","September 17, 2018",3,"I absolutely USED to love, love this app. until the update. We've tried experimenting with and getting used to it. The more we use it, the more it looks like many options are missing. My child used to like to color both the boy and girl pictures; listen to boy and girl books. This is no longer available. She used to listen to the different fun environment info & sometimes do the quiz after. That is no longer an option. The app has never been left hand friendly, but we've gotten used to it. Now it's not even child friendly."

So far I have had this app on a little scholar tablet, A 7inch LG tab and a galaxy tablet the little scholar tab lagged a little on certain games. We have started mainly using the website though as it is much easier. Their tech support wasn't helpful at all when my childs learning path stopped working. They offered no solution and closed my ticket. I did figure it out on my own, for anyone with that issue go to your parent settings and change their learning plan up or down a level, load it on their profile and then go back into your parent settings and put them back."

The same goes with pictures. It's annoying to screen shot a picture to just to see IF my son is in a picture. I spend alot of time going through my gallery to see which dojo pics are current/relevant. Let me zoom in for 5 stars!!!"

It used to have the arrow icon, recently it has the ""oops"" message.  We've uninstalled and reinstalled from the Play store, but it still only plays for a few minutes before ""oops"". If we pick a show and do the play all, it will make it through all of the available episodes, and only fail (with the arrow) once it reaches the end of the full episodes. It won't go on to play the clips.  Not sure if you have any ideas for troubleshooting or if it will be fixed with the next update. A reinstall didn't fix it.  4 stars because before this it worked perfectly."

,"Rachel Lena Beeson","September 4, 2018",1,"This app is anoying to use and they heckel you when you try to cancel your subscription. They refused to refund me for a month even though my child didn't once touch the app and I cancled it at the begining of the month they had charged me for!!"
,"Kiryn Silverwing","September 4, 2018",1,"It uses predatory practices of having you enter credit card information that will auto-bill when you sign up for the free trial, hoping you'll forget to cancel, and offering a hefty discount to trap you into a year subscription before you even start the trial! You can thankfully cancel through the app, but it takes going through 10 pages of ""yes I'm sure I want to cancel"" as they try to convince you not to. This is not a sign of an app that people WANT to keep using. As for the app itself, the buttons are way too small and there's so much on the page that it's hard to read. The back button is perfectly in the spot where my daughter holds the phone, so it's way too easy to press and leave the current activity and get lost in a menu somewhere. The ""puzzles"" automatically put the pieces in the right place if she so much as touches them, so I doubt she's actually learning anything. Every click of every button results in a 2-3 second load time, even in the menus! This was the first phone game I showed my daughter where she got so frustrated that she started yelling no and hitting my phone! Maybe it's good for older kids, but for preschoolers, hell no."

,"George Meadows","April 25, 2019",5,"Brilliant! I didn't use the app to learn a language completely but my use of it as a refresher was excellent. I thoroughly enjoy the activities and the reminders help you keep on top of a language. I thoroughly recommend this to anyone trying to practice a language or prevent themselves from going out of practice. 10/10 would learn again 👌"

,"ringoffire0","January 21, 2017",5,"It's a nice app to watch PBS kids episodes without having to go to their website on a phone. Loved how they added a fast forward/backward scrubber bar - no longer must I replay a whole episode if I missed something! (I'm kidding). However, I am a little disappointed that they removed the feature that allowed one to save a show as a ""favourite"", thereby placing a certain show's icon to the top of the shows list on the right to make it quicker to find when the app is loaded. I also dislike that if I click on one show's icon while another is being played, the latter stops and the one clicked is instantly played. What if the click was accidental or I just wanted to see what episodes that show had? I'd rather have it so that the original show still plays until a specific episode or clip from the other show is clicked, rather than it's icon. The scrubber bar lessens the pain of going back though!"

However, the scoring is frustrating, often not registering complete lessons or earning 73 XP (points) but the app only registering 45. It makes scoring and the leaderboards worthless. More importantly it makes reaching daily goals more difficult, often having to complete additional lessons to meet the goal."

No issues at first but a few weeks ago they must have done an update because now it won't cast at all. The PBS Kids logo appears on the TV with the Loading icon spinning and it never gets beyond that anymore. Irritating because my child loved watching the newer Sesame Street episodes and now can't."

characters who spew nonsense words. We are trying to get this child to 
speak English, and we have Super Why making up words that mean absolutely 
nothing... The worst part of this game is, it's prei stalled in the Kids

As a lazy person who prefers the easy way of making reviewers, I DEFINITELY recommend this. The in-app purchases is well reasonable. I'd definitely pay for the app when I am able for both support to the developers and for the app perks. Thank you for this! Kudos!"

,"S Garner","January 29, 2018",2,"I love the idea of this program, but there are way to many cons. I paid $59 sale price for the year, which was a great. To use the program or access your account you have to download the app just for it to take you to what looks like a website version of ABCmouse and have you login everytime on the app.  Also if you buy the year access you will be placed on auto renew, so make sure your email is correct and up to date so you receive you billing notifications.  The program is bombarded with so much that my son got frustrated and gave up to play with something else. The app freezes and shuts down at random times, causing us to wait through loading screens again. This happened on mutiple devices which had a great internet connection and device specs."

Not sure how this company is still in business. From people forgetting to cancel? Maybe the web version works."

It was fun at first but the later lessons take far longer to complete and it's really frustrating that it doesn't tell you how you're messing up the lessons. It just says WRONG and moves on. It is so annoying to translate a 10+ word sentence and miss by one letter and have to type it all over and over again."

,"Jessica Olson","December 28, 2017",2,"They will continue charging you even if your credit card expires or is lost and you've notified your bank:  My son did enjoy this app for a very short amount of time, but he tired of it fairly quickly. He had not used the app for over a year.  In that time, I lost my my purse, including my old atm card, had to get a new phone and completely forgot about our subscription. Then Christmas rolls around.  I go into my bank account and see a charge for $59.99 from ABCMouse. Livid, I downloaded the app, logged in and the only way to get a hold of someone is to send an email and wait. I send an email.  Being a very impatient person, i go online and search for a phone number.  Finally find one on a thread not associated with this business, call and proceed to sit on hold for we'll over an hour before someone finally answered.  Fortunately, the person i spoke with was able to refund the money that had been charged to my new atm card (how that is even possible, i still so not know) and 2 weeks later, I'm still waiting for the funds to hit my account.  It is written in the small print that they will automatically deduct the funds from your account when you sign up, but i think it's  shady to use a card they were not authorized to use.  Then they blamed me for not reading the fine print, which i did, however, any other service i have ever used with ongoing charges had automatically cancelled if the card on file had be been cancelled for any reason and have sent an email asking for updated payment.   In my opinion, this company is absolutely unprofessional. I will never trust them with any of my account information after this"

,"Matthew Hoskisson","April 26, 2019",4,"I learned a second language by living in that country, and now I'm trying to learn a third using Duolingo. In my opinion, this app will help you learn some vocabulary but you will not become fluent by using this app."
,"David Tyberg","April 26, 2019",3,"I'm really pleased with the recent improvements. That said, instead of the toy language from Game of Thrones, it'd be nice if y'all focused on languages that are spoken by nearly half a billion people like, for instance, Arabic. More people speak Arabic than French by nearly 200M, almost as many as Spanish. That's kind of a gaping hole, y'all."

,"A Google User","April 26, 2019",4,"I'm glad they've changed the cost of testing out of a level to 5 lingots instead of 20. However, the volume of different types of exercises in a lesson can be too soft or too loud, which is really annoying."
